# DEVOPS BEST PRACTICES

1. **Implement Least Privilege:** Ensure that each component or user has the minimum access necessary to perform its function.

2. **Use Secure Secrets Management:** Store sensitive information like API keys and passwords in a secure vault (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

3. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Protect critical resources like CI/CD tools and repositories with MFA.

4. **Automate Security Testing:** Integrate security checks (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) into the CI/CD pipeline to catch vulnerabilities early.

5. **Encrypt Data:** Ensure both data at rest and in transit are encrypted, using strong encryption protocols.

6. **Implement Code Signing:** Use code signing to ensure the integrity and authenticity of your code before deployment.

7. **Regularly Rotate Credentials:** Change access keys, passwords, and tokens regularly to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

8. **Audit and Monitor:** Continuously monitor and log all activities in the CI/CD pipeline, and regularly audit logs for unusual activity.

9. **Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Securely:** Apply security best practices to IaC templates (e.g., Terraform) by scanning them for misconfigurations.

10. **Enforce Strong Branching Policies:** Use protected branches, pull requests, and code reviews to ensure only approved and tested code is merged and deployed.
